1.1.1 Entrance
--------------
*
&0You are advised to clear the entrance
&0for the marine drop crew by removing 
&0crate and barrel barricades and 
&0dispatching any &1xenomorphs&0 you may
&0encounter.
#
&0Note that due to the protective design
&0of the &1barrels&0 [for transportation],
&0your 9mm will be ineffective in their
&0removal. Search out alternative means.
*
Icon: Crate & barrel

1.1.2 Outer Complex
-------------------
*
&0You must locate the main junction room
&0and activate all three control panels.
&0This will allow further penetration
&0into the colony.
#
&0Pick up any &1seismic survey charges&0 as
&0they are essential for the removal of
&1temporary walls.&0

*

1.1.3 Ammunition Dump 1
-----------------------
*
&0You may re-arm your arsenal here but 
&0we can only hover for &160 seconds&0 as
&0the area is about to self-destruct.
#
&0Ensure that you arm up before we pull 
&0you out.
*

1.2.2 Recreation Rooms
----------------------
*
&0The recapture of the colony is
&0progressing well. However, as we have 
&0feared, our &1security&0 people have been 
&0infected and must be eliminated.
#
&0Power up &1all of the lights&0, destroy 
&0anything that lives, and pull out so that
&0we may remove any carcasses and 
&0secure the area for re-habitation.
*

1.3.1 Medical Laboratory
------------------------
*
&0Once again, an area of the colony 
&0has been totally infected. 

&0Retire all &1enemy lifeforms
&0so that the marines may enter and 
&0secure the area and remove any 
&0suspect biological samples for 
&0destruction.
&0#
&0Collect all &1ID tags&0 so we can confirm
&0that no samples have been removed 
&0without our knowledge.
*

1.1.4 Ammunition Dump 2
-----------------------
*
&0You may re-arm your arsenal here but 
&0we can only hover for &160 seconds&0 as
&0the area is about to self-destruct.
#
&0Ensure that you arm up before we pull 
&0you out.
*

1.4.1 Garage
------------
*
&0Before the mass infection, some
&0colonists sought to smuggle samples 
&0out for personal gain: allegedly on 
&0behalf of the Company.
#
&0The garage area was the central point
&0for crates entering and leaving the 
&0colony. It is imperative that you
&1destroy all crates and their contents
&0to ensure that this illegal trade does 
&0not resume.
*

1.1.5 Ammunition Dump 3
-----------------------
*
&0You may re-arm your arsenal here but 
&0we can only hover for &160 seconds&0 as
&0the area is about to self-destruct.
#
&0Ensure that you arm up before we pull 
&0you out.
*

1.5.4 Atmosphere Sub-level
--------------------------
*
&0This entire section is the beginning
&0of an ideal cocoon storage area for the 
&0xenomorph and is the outer reaches of
&0what we believe to be the Queen's nest.
#
&0Previously, &1Synthetics&0 were dropped in
&0to protect the colonists, but it seems
&0that all colonists &1have been infected.
&0The &1Synthetics&0 are still guarding. 
&0Remove them to gain access to the 
&0xenomorph lair.
*

1.5.5 Security Catwalks
-----------------------
*
&0You may re-arm your arsenal here. The 
&0heat from the processor is extreme and
&0may cause the craft to stall. We can 
&0only hover for &130 seconds&0.
*

1.6.1 Atmosphere Sub-Basement
-----------------------------
*
&0You must seek out all the remaining
&0colonists and retrieve their &1ID tags&0 so
&0that we may assess the speed and level
&0of infection.
#
&0We believe that these &1colonists&0 are
&0alive. We must insist that you 
&0perform a thorough search of the area
&0to check for nests, where the colonists
&0may be stored.
*

1.6.2 Queen's Lair
------------------
*
&0It appears you have found the &1Queen&0.
&0Eliminate her so that any traces of life
&0may be removed from the area and we 
&0can re-populate the colony once again.
#
&0Good luck.
*
Icon: Queen's head/ Egg closed
2.1.1 Living Area
-----------------
*
&0The prison has been lost to a &1new&0 
&0strain of xenomorph.
#
&0Destroy any living organism and &1seek 
&0out any hidden weapons caches&0 that 
&0were stockpiled by the former inmates.
&0Do not let anything stand in your way.
*

2.1.2 Canteen
-------------
*
&0This is a maximum security area.
&0
&0All of the prisoners are missing.
&0Their &1ID tags&0 are scattered throughout
&0this section.
#
&1Retrieve&0 all of these &1ID tags&0 so that
&0a thorough assessment can be made
&0of the capability of this new strain
&0of xenomorph.
*

2.1.3 Meeting Tower
-------------------
*
&0We must have access to the &1Central&0
&1Meeting Tower&0. The age and design
&0of the machinery within this area
&0has many of the control panels for
&0activating access-platforms away
&0from the vicinity of their 
&0respective mechanisms.
#
&0Ensure that you &1lower all lifts&0 and
&1open all doors&0 to give free access
&0to the entire tower complex.
*

2.2.2 Leadworks
---------------
*
&0Due to the amount of time this section
&0has been without maintenance, many of
&0the &1pressurized gas-pipes&0 supplying the
&0leadworks have fallen into decay and
&0make entry very treacherous.
#
&0Find the control panels that activate the
&0gas supply to &1the flame jets&0 and &1stem&0
&1the flow of gas&0.
*

2.4.2 Tunnels and Ducts
-----------------------
*
&0We have managed to hold the fans for
&0a short period of time. You must get 
&0in there and re-arm from the stockpile 
&0hidden by the inmates.
#
&0We estimate that you have &160 seconds&0.
*

2.3.1 Mining and Smelting
-------------------------
*
&0Once again, we have information that 
&0leads us to the conclusion that an illegal 
&0operation was being set up to export
&0samples back to earth for personal
&0gain. This was totally &1against&0 the prison
&0religion.
#
&1Destroy any crates&0 that may contain
&0samples and any organisms that stand
&0in your way.
*

2.3.2 Furnace Controls
----------------------
*
&0The high level of heat and pressure
&0has caused steam pipes to burst,
&0making the area highly dangerous.
#
&0Get in there, find the control panels
&0for the &1steam&0 and make sure that
&0they are &1turned off&0 to allow a
&0follow-up crew safe access.
*

2.4.3 Tunnels and Ducts
-----------------------
*
&0We have managed to hold the fans for
&0a short period of time. You must get 
&0in there and re-arm from the stockpile 
&0hidden by the inmates.
#
&0We estimate that you have &160 seconds&0.
*


2.6.2 Lead Mould
----------------
*
&0You will be dropped into an area known
&0to be inhabited by a &1Dog strain&0 of the
&0xenomorph. This strain is highly
&0dangerous and has, so far, managed to
&0stop any attempt of securing the
&0area.
#
&0Get in there and &1access all areas&0
&0by opening all &1doors via control panels&0
&0in the main chamber.
#
*


2.6.3 Queen's Lair
------------------
*
&0The Queen has been located and has to
&0be destroyed if we are to rebuild
&0the prison for other offenders.
#
&1Destroy her&0 and &1her spawn&0 so
&0we may clean up and remove any 
&0evidence of this thing.
*

3.1.1 Tunnels.
--------------
*
&0We believe the original xenomorph 
&0infection came from within this 
&0derelict &1Boneship&0. We must 
&0investigate the area to find the origin 
&0of the xenomorph on this planet.
#
&0Use the bio-mechanical &1lifts&0 and clear 
&0the way to the main Pilot's Chamber 
&0so that we may enter freely and 
&0remove the carcasses for testing
&0and subsequent destruction.
*

3.2.1 Pilot's Chamber
---------------------
*
&0You now have free access to the entire
&0Boneship from these chambers. Find the 
&1active airlock&0 to progress deeper.
#
&0You must secure each section of the 
&0entire vessel from this central point 
&0to ensure that our landing crews
&0may enter freely.
*

3.3.1 Canyons and Catacombs
---------------------------
*
&0In a previous attempt to hold this
&0area of the vessel, rogue &1dog&0
&0strains of the xenomorph escaped
&0captivity.
#
&0Search for hidden lairs where 
&0they may reside and &1destroy these &0
&1xenomorphs&0.
*

3.2.2 Pilot's Chamber
---------------------
*
&0Well done. You have arrived back at
&0the central section of the ship and have
&0opened &1another air-lock&0.
#
&0Do not delay. There are more areas to
&0secure and time is against us.
*

3.5.1 Secrets
-------------
*
&0The previous landing crew were
&0caught and infected. Find these
&0members and kill them so that they
&0cannot spawn any more of their 
&0kind.
#
&0Remember to collect their &1ID tags
&0as proof that each is &1eliminated&0.
*

3.5.2 Inorganics 1
------------------
*
&0We have detected Inorganic Materials
&0near an area known to be inhabited
&0by adult xenomorphs. We believe that 
&0these are Munitions.
#
&0You have &145 seconds&0 
&0to get in there and restock
&0before we pull you out of this
&0potentially dangerous area.
*

3.2.3 Pilot's Chamber
---------------------
*
&0You are re-entering the &1main&0
&1chamber&0 of this ship. Your efforts
&0have opened up another section that
&0can be secured. 
#
&0Unfortunately, you have inadvertently 
&0allowed some &1xenomorphs&0 back into 
&0these chambers. It would be wise to
&1dispatch them&0 before moving on.
*

3.7.1 Droplifts
---------------
*
&1Synthetics&0 have previously been placed
&0in this area to &1deter&0 any potential
&0sample &1smugglers&0. We are now unable
&0to remove them. These synthetic 
&0workers will kill on sight.
#
&0After studying our data we feel that
&0the company can sustain the credit loss 
&0of these... employees. &1Remove them&0 so 
&0the area can be accessed.
*

3.5.3 Inorganics 2
------------------
*
&0We have detected more Inorganic 
&0Materials in the Boneship. We again
&0believe that these are Munitions.
#
&0You have &145 seconds&0 
&0to get in there and restock
&0before we pull you out of this
&0potentially dangerous area.
*

3.2.4 Pilot's Chamber
---------------------
*
&0You are re-entering the main
&0chamber of this ship. Your efforts
&0have opened up another section that
&0can be secured. Judging by the
&0warrior presence, you must be very
&0deep into the Boneship.
*


3.8.1 Egg Chambers
------------------
*
&0We believe that you are &1close&0 to 
&0the &1central&0 hatchery which contains
&0enough eggs to infect any large
&0colony.
#
&1Destroy&0 all of the &1eggs&0 to ensure
&0the future of any visitors to this
&0barren place.
*

3.2.5 Pilot's Chamber
---------------------
*
&0You are approaching the last few 
&0sections of the &1Boneship&0. Beware as
&0our information leads us to 
&0understand that a &1Queen&0 has been 
&0building a nest.
#
&0Make sure that you &1clear the main&0
&1chamber&0 of any threats so we may
&0remove the dead pilot for study.
*

3.9.1 Queen's lair
------------------
*
&0The final task is at hand.
#
&0It ends where it once began.
#
&0You &1must&0 succeed.
#
*
