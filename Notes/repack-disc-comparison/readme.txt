# Alien Trilogy – Repack vs. Disc Comparison Archive

This directory contains a curated archive of differences between a known repack of *Alien Trilogy (PC)* and a verified disc image, likely a German release.

## Contents

- `absent_from_disc.txt`: Files present in the repack but not on the disc.
- `absent_from_repack.txt`: Files present on the disc but not in the repack.
- `different_files_disc.txt`: Files differing between the two versions from the disc.
- `garbage_files_disc.txt`: Placeholder files with no localization value not included.
- `unnecessary-files.txt`: A list of files that are not required for the repacked version of the game to run, some appear to be development leftovers and others are not required because the repack mounts the disc image (such as the video files) to a virtual drive. ( Total size: ~**79.9MB**)
- `CLEANUPSCRIPT/`: A batch script and two file lists for deleting the unnecessary files and creating the required files.
- `DIFFERENTFILES/`: Higher-quality, differing or corrected versions of existing assets.
- `DEMO/`: Files unique to the official *Alien Trilogy* demo release.
- `DOCUMENTATION/`: Copies of the BND and MAP documentation from the Archive.org backups.

- `MISSINGFILES/`: Files missing from the repack, organized into their original directories.
- `REQUIREDFILES/`: This empty file is required for the game to launch if the files from the unnecessary-files.txt list are removed from the game. [NOTE: This is still pending a full playthrough to be absolutely certain that it works, but when files are not there which are needed it generally doesn't launch.]

Disc sourced from [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/Acclaim_Alien_Trilogy_MSDOS_1996_Eng)  
Total files: **119**  
Total size: ~**3.29MB**

Other versions checked :

Demo files: [AlienTrilogy_1020](https://archive.org/details/AlienTrilogy_1020)  
Demo archive total size: ~**22.1MB** (files unique to the standalone demo release, not present in the full game)

The TRILOGY (executable) folder was not compared, I saw nothing of interest, a slightly larger executable and very similar driver and executable files.

## Other versions checked:

- [AlienTrilogyUSA](https://archive.org/details/AlienTrilogyUSA) — Identical to the verified disc version.
- [alien-trilogy.-7z](https://archive.org/details/alien-trilogy.-7z) — Identical to the repack.
- [Redump.org16276](https://archive.org/details/Redump.org16276) — Practically identical to the repack, only contains extra installer batch files.

All files are preserved *as-is* for the sake of historical integrity and future research.
