TRILOGY ( the executable ) folder was not compared, I saw nothing of interest, a slightly larger executable and very similar driver and executable files.

## Other versions checked:

- [AlienTrilogyUSA](https://archive.org/details/AlienTrilogyUSA) — Identical to the verified disc version.
- [alien-trilogy.-7z](https://archive.org/details/alien-trilogy.-7z) — Identical to the repack.
- [Redump.org16276](https://archive.org/details/Redump.org16276) — Practically identical to the repack, only contains extra installer batch files.

All files kept as-is for integrity and preservation.
