# Alien Trilogy Resurrection

This project aims to create a modding toolkit and possibly more for Alien Trilogy.

- 1 : Install the game from : https://collectionchamber.blogspot.com/2017/05/alien-trilogy.html
- 2 : Download and install the toolkit from here, place it in the same directory as the "Run.exe" file.
	- Currently there is no release so you will have to build it yourself until the time I issue a release.
