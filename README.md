# Alien Trilogy Resurrection

This project aims to create a modding toolkit and possibly more for Alien Trilogy.

- 1 : Install the game from : https://collectionchamber.blogspot.com/2017/05/alien-trilogy.html
- 2 : Download and install the toolkit from here, place it in the same directory as the "Run.exe" file.
	- Currently there is no release so you will have to build it yourself until the time I issue a release.

They also pointed me to the file format documentation, the links to which are also in their repository on the great preserver archive.org which will save me endless amounts of time manually decoding the filetypes.
