# Alien Trilogy Resurrection

This project aims to create a modding toolkit and possibly more for Alien Trilogy.

- 1 : Install the game from : https://collectionchamber.blogspot.com/2017/05/alien-trilogy.html
- 2 : Download and install the toolkit from here, place it in the same directory as the "Run.exe" file.
- 3 : Optional : Use the cleanup script and files provided in "Notes\repack-disc-comparison\CLEANUPSCRIPT" to delete 83.35MBs of unused files from the game. ( documentation and details on these files and more can be found in "Notes\repack-disc-comparison\readme.txt" )

# To Do List

- Palettes aren't right for the following two files?
	- PANEL3GF.BND
	- PANELGFX.BND
- Compressed images can not be replaced yet, until I implement a recompression algorithm.

Special thanks to Bobblen147 who created this repository : https://github.com/Bobblen147/atril_geom_extract

They also pointed me to the file format documentation, the links to which are also in their repository on the great preserver archive.org which will save me endless amounts of time manually decoding the filetypes.
